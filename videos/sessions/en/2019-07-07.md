As container technology becomes more and more widespread in the industry,
how to distribute images efficiently and safely is a new challenge for engineers.
Project Dragonfly is an open source intelligent P2P based image and file distribution system.
Its goal is to tackle all distribution problems in cloud native scenarios.
Currently Dragonfly focuses on being:
• Simple: well-defined user-facing API (HTTP), non-invasive to all container engines.
• Efficient: CDN support, P2P based file distribution to save enterprise bandwidth.
• Intelligent: host level speed limit, intelligent flow control due to host dection.
• Secure: block transmission encrytion, HTTPS connection support  In this presentation,
we will focus on the distribution of container images through Dragonfly.
We will review and provide solutions to challenges faced by organizations,
including mass distribution, secure transmission, bandwidth cost.
Real world use cases will be discussed in the session.
